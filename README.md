## About Me

Hi! I'm a developer who enjoys building small things that slowly grow into something bigger.  
I work across both **web** and **game** projects, but I don't really like to label myself as “full-stack” — I’m still learning, experimenting, and figuring things out as I go.

I’m interested in creating interactive experiences and tools that are fun or genuinely useful, even if they start simple.

## What I usually work with

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, Lua  
- **Web**: HTML, CSS, React, Node.js  
- **Game Development**: Unity, Roblox Studio  
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, Unity

I don’t think of myself as an expert — just someone who enjoys building things, breaking things, and learning from both.
